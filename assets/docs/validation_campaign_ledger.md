# XREPORT Validation Campaign Ledger

Last updated: 2026-10-18

This ledger summarizes current validation gates, release evidence, and known
scope limits. The [project status ledger](project_status_ledger.md) owns
component status and active issues; architecture and workflow documents own
their respective contracts. This is not a per-run archive.

Validation here means technical software evidence for a stated scope. It does
not establish clinical validity, diagnostic performance, regulatory approval,
or suitability for patient care.

## Gate map

| Tier | Scope | Current result | Boundary |
| ---: | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | CI baseline, source readiness, deterministic quality gates, rendered [startup](runtime/startup.md) | `PASS` (`S00`–`S03`) | Recheck the current candidate revision before release; source launcher edge cases remain partial in the status ledger. |
| 1 | UI state, settings, jobs, [persistence](architecture/persistence.md), filesystem controls | `PASS` (`S10`–`S15`) | Scope is the exercised local SQLite and PostgreSQL 16 contracts. |
| 2 | [Dataset, training, and evaluation workflows](operations/workflows.md) | `PASS` (`S20`–`S28`) | Technical workflows use synthetic or small datasets; this is not representative-data or clinical-quality evidence. |
| 3 | Catalogue, installation, browser inference, custom and public [models](runtime/local_inference_models.md) | Complete (`S30`–`S37`; `S35` retired) | `CXRMate-ED` was retired after collapsing distinct fixtures; MedGemma's gated behavior passed, but model access remains blocked. Model quality remains unvalidated. |
| 4 | Heavy providers and Windows desktop [deployment](runtime/deployment.md) | `PARTIAL` (`S40`–`S43`) | `S42` passed on a CUDA-capable host; GPU-less CUDA fallback is untested. The v3.2.0 release package scope is recorded below. |
| 5 | Recovery, concurrency, [accessibility](ui/experience.md), performance | `PARTIAL` (`S50`–`S53`) | `S51` remains partial for broader contention and hardware coverage. Browser accessibility checks passed; spoken screen-reader output was not observed. |

Run the Tier 0 sequence in order: `S00 → S01 → S03 → S02`. A failed hard gate
blocks claims about dependent workflows until the current source is repaired
and revalidated. Select the smallest relevant regression set for other changes;
see [testing and quality rules](coding/testing_and_quality.md).

## Current release evidence

- v3.2.0 was [published](https://github.com/CTCycle/XREPORT-radiological-reports-generator/releases/tag/v3.2.0)
  on 2026-10-18 from source `a8d75a0c0d5f02a29c85e9ac58f4837fc3081449`.
  [Package run 39056753392](https://github.com/CTCycle/XREPORT-radiological-reports-generator/actions/runs/39056753392)
  supplied the accepted CPU and CUDA artifacts;
  [release workflow run 39103683278](https://github.com/CTCycle/XREPORT-radiological-reports-generator/actions/runs/39103683278)
  published them. The tag resolves to the source commit, all
  eight published SHA-256 digests match the [approved release manifest](../QA/validation_campaign/release-validation/approved-release-manifest.json),
  and release verification plus portable smoke passed for both variants.
- CPU and CUDA portable and MSI packages were exercised on an RTX 3060 Windows
  host. Native routes, Training submit/cancel, active-work close/reopen,
  synthetic inference, and install/uninstall lifecycles passed. CPU inference
  resolved to `cpu` with CUDA unused; CUDA inference resolved to `cuda:0`.
- The final CPU MSI uninstall returned exit code `0`; no product registration,
  install tree, shortcut, XREPORT process, or listener remained.
- This is a technical release scope. No GPU-less Windows host was available,
  so CUDA fallback remains untested. `S42` and `S51` remain `PARTIAL`; these
  gaps do not invalidate the narrower package results. Synthetic inference is
  not clinical or diagnostic-performance evidence.

## Durable decisions and limits

- `CXRMate-ED` remains retired: its bounded qualification run produced the
  same full report for three distinct fixtures. Do not restore it without a
  new independent qualification. See [local inference models](runtime/local_inference_models.md).
- The MedGemma gated-provider contract is validated, including rejection
  before job start and a disabled Generate action. Real installation and
  inference require authorized provider access; see `ISSUE-002` in the
  [status ledger](project_status_ledger.md).
- `S50` recovery, `S52` responsive/accessibility checks, and `S53` source
  performance baselines passed for their stated technical scopes. Packaged
  timing, genuine no-GPU fallback, broader representative-data behavior, and
  spoken accessibility remain outside those results.
- Public-model technical checks and output review do not show diagnostic
  accuracy. Keep model readiness and `validation_status` separate from any
  clinical or quality claim.

## Evidence and maintenance

- Keep current outcomes, source revision, scope, and limitations in this
  ledger or the component entry in the status ledger. Link existing tests,
  CI runs, architecture/workflow docs, or the release manifest where they
  support the claim; do not create a parallel report for each slice.
- Store screenshots, logs, and working QA reports under `assets/QA/`. Keep
  only artifacts required by project tooling in the tracked tree. The approved
  release manifest remains tracked because the release verifier consumes it
  and it binds one source commit to the published artifact hashes.
- Keep `PASS`, `PARTIAL`, `BLOCKED`, `FAIL`, and `UNTESTED` scoped to what was
  actually exercised. A unit test does not prove a browser workflow; a
  synthetic technical run does not prove model quality; package evidence does
  not prove behavior on hardware that was not tested.
- When a regression is found, record the affected scope, fix it narrowly, run
  the adjacent checks, and update the relevant status and limit. Do not retain
  superseded failures as active issues.
